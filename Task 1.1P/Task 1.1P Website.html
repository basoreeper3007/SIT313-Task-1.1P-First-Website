        <p>This is my Arduino Security Rover Project from SIT217.
          My rover was one of three rovers in a security system.
          The purpose of my rover was to be able to remotley control it from
          a phone and view the outside of your property with a camera module.

        <p>This is my Arduino Laptop Fan Project from SIT123.
          My laptop fan was automatic, turning on when a certain
          temperature on the temperature sensor was detected.
          The fan also had different modes in relation to fan speed
          that were activated when the laptop temperature met a certain
          threshold.

        <img src="unnamed.jpg" alt="Maccas Freezer System">
        <p>This is my McDonalds Freezer Notification and Alarm System.
          This embedded system used a Raspberry PI and a Particle Argon.
          The Particle Argon circuit on the left is the freezer device with
          a green button to notify that the freezer is in use, and a red alarm
          button in case of emergency. The Raspberry PI device on the right would
          be located in the managers office or somewhere within range of the crew.
          It recieves messages reagrding the button states on the Particle Argon
          device, if the green button is pressed, the green LED turns on, if the
          red button is pressed, the red LED and a buzzer will activate.
